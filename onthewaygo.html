    <img class="frames-resp" src="Frame 14 resp.svg" alt="">
    <p class="para2">In the initial stages of our project, I embarked on the process of wireframing to visualize and structure the user interface (UI) design. The wireframes served as foundational blueprints, outlining the layout and functionality of each page within our application.

        After careful consideration, I selected a wireframe that encapsulated the core elements and navigation flow essential to our project objectives. This wireframe became the cornerstone of our interface design, guiding the development of subsequent pages and functionalities.
        
        Utilizing this chosen wireframe as a reference point, I began to iterate and expand upon its framework, gradually fleshing out additional pages and refining the interface elements. This iterative approach allowed for continuous improvement, as each iteration incorporated feedback, user testing insights, and evolving project requirements.</p>

    <h3>Usability Study Findings</h3>
    <h4>Round 1</h4>
    <p class="para2">During the intial stage of the project, I conducted Usability study of my wireframes and prototypes
        the feedback I received indicates that the user journey was not that intuitive and that users were having 
        difficulty completing tasks. this was a major challenge, as it meant that i needed to redesign the app to make it more user-friendly.
        , I found that the navigation bar was difficult to find and use, so I redesigned it to be more intuitive. I also reduced the number of columns from three to two, which made the website easier to scan and navigate.

    <h2 id="refine">Refinig the design</h2>
    <h3>Mockups</h3>
    <p class="para3">I addressed the Usability issues by iterating on my designs and incorporating feedback from users. I made changes to the layout, navigation, and
        information architecture of the app to make it easier. After incorporating the feedback received, I proceeded to design the remaining pages. With most of the mockups completed, I'm considering conducting another usability study to gather insights from users regarding the design changes. Their feedback will be invaluable in refining the design further and ensuring it aligns closely with user preferences and needs.

    <h3>Usability Study Findings</h3>
    <h4>Round 2</h4>
    <img class="frames" src="Group 276.png" alt="">
    <img class="frames-resp" src="Group 187 1.png" alt="">
    <p class="para3">With my mockups ready, I decided to conduct another usability test. During the study, I observed that having to choose the delivery option after adding an item to the cart added unnecessary complexity for users. Many participants expressed confusion, stating that they expected to select the delivery type while still on the add-to-cart page.

        To address this issue, I redesigned the process. Now, on the homepage, users are presented with a pop-up card prompting them to choose the type of delivery before selecting any food items. This adjustment streamlines the user experience by allowing them to make their delivery preference clear upfront, simplifying the subsequent steps of adding items to the cart.</p>

    <h2 id="takeaway">Going Forward</h2>
    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <p class="para4">This project taught me the user-centered design. by conducting usability testing early
        and often, I was able to identify and address usability issues before they become major problems. I also
        learned the importance of iteration and being willing to adapt my designs based on user feedback.
        overall, I am proud of the success of this project. I believe that this app will be a valuable tool for busy 
        people who want to eat healthy and delicious meals without having to cook.

        <h3>Next Step</h3>
        <p class="para4">"I'm so excited about the possibility of seeing this cafe app in the hand of real users! collaborating with the engineering team 
            would be an amazing opportunity to learn and contribute to making its impact a reality. if given the chance, I'm eager to hand off my designs
            and actively participate in this exciting next step."
